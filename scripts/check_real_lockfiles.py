"""Check that wheelgap still reads real projects' lockfiles (#227).

    uv run python scripts/check_real_lockfiles.py                # every project's current lockfile
    uv run python scripts/check_real_lockfiles.py pluggy cleo    # just these (the folder names in sources.toml)
    uv run python scripts/check_real_lockfiles.py --pinned       # the copies in tests/fixtures/real/, offline

tests/fixtures/real/sources.toml lists real lockfiles from open-source projects: two uv.lock, two poetry.lock, a
pdm.lock, a pylock.toml and a Pipfile.lock. By default this downloads each project's current file from its default
branch (raw.githubusercontent.com, no token; a dev script, so it uses urllib rather than wheelgap's pypi.fetch_json)
and reads it with wheelgap. tests/test_real_lockfiles.py runs the same checks on the pinned copies, offline, and
also pins how many cells are `n/a` and how many markers were read, which this can't know for a file it hasn't seen.

What it finds falls in three kinds:

- **misread**: wheelgap reads the file in a way that would give a wrong or `unknown` answer.
  - It can't read it, or reads no packages.
  - A package has a parse error, or a version, marker or requires-python that doesn't parse.
  - In a lock that records filenames (all but Pipfile.lock), a package has no files recorded, a file that's neither
    a wheel nor an sdist, or a wheel name that doesn't parse.
  - The file has a different number of packages, files, markers, dependencies or dependency versions than
    wheelgap read. These are counted straight from the TOML or JSON, under the old and likely new key names
    (`marker` and `markers`, `wheels` and `wheel`), so a renamed key shows up here.
  - Poetry's lock-version says the lock has a dependency graph (before 2.1) and wheelgap didn't use it, or the
    other way round.
  - Far fewer wheels per package than in the pinned copy.
  - A package is `n/a` on every target (CPython 3.8 to the newest, on every `-t all` platform) and nothing on its
    way in has a marker: its markers or the dependency graph were misread.
  - A package is `unknown` on some target.
- **upstream changed**: the project changed in a way the corpus should follow, so refresh it (AGENTS.md says how).
  - The file is gone (404).
  - A format version the tests don't cover yet (KNOWN_FORMATS).
  - A package wheelgap skips for a reason other than being a local project (a git or URL dependency, say), or one
    with an empty list of files.
- **warning** (doesn't fail): a package is `n/a` on every target, but only through markers, e.g. on
  `implementation_name == 'pypy'` or an old Python: probably right, but worth a look.

Each lockfile gets a line, `ok`, `warn` or `FAIL`, with its format version, and each finding is printed under it.
Text from the lockfile is printed with repr() and without backticks, so it can't start a line or close the job
summary's code block. The exit code is 1 if anything failed. .github/workflows/lockfile-corpus.yml runs this weekly.
It needs the network (except with --pinned), so the tests never run its download.
